VideoDirector5
==============

VideoDirector5 is a script designed to enable control of Wirecast 5 from a Korg nanoKONTROL2 midi control surface on MacOS X computers. The Korg nanoKONTROL2 is a low-cost solution to providing a tactile interface which, while not as elegant as a real production video switcher, provides much more tactile feedback than trying to control a video production with a mouse or touchpad.

In addition to simply providing real physical buttons for video switching operations, VideoDirector5 also simplifies the process of populating the various control layers of Wirecast with video and graphic content. It will load layer content from a pre-defined directory structure on the host machine, allowing rapid re-configuration of Wirecast for programs with differing content requirements.

The functionality of VideoDirector5 is limited by the very restricted subset of Wirecast operations for which Telestream has exposed a scriptable interface. The most obvious omission is that there appears to be no way to script the master audio level control, either through the Wirecast API or via System Events scripting. For a control surface such as the Korg NanoKontrol with its many sliders and knobs, this is a galling omission.

This version of VideoDirector5 is not intended to be used with Wirecast 4.

Download the zip archive, unzip and place the VideoDirector5 folder in the Documents folder of your wirecast machine.  VideoDirector4/docs/index.html contains complete configuration and operation instructions.

VideoDirector 5 is still pre-release code.  Expect bugs and changes.  Check back often.
